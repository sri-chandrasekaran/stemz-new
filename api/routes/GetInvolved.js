            <p>Contact us to inquire about us hosting an after-school program at your elementary school. 
                The after school program would consist of our in person courses, and we will provide the materials.

                to increase outreach in your area.</p>

            <p>Our program teaches students through experimentation. Unfortunately, experiments cost money. 
                We want to keep our classes free and donations help us buy materials for our in person classes.</p>
