# Refactoring Plan for the Codebase

This refactoring plan aims to improve the structure, maintainability, and scalability of the codebase by focusing on three main areas: Routing, Pages, and Components. 

## 1. Routing

### Current State
- The routing is handled in `src/App.js`, where all routes are defined in a single file.
- The routes are tightly coupled with the components, making it difficult to manage as the application grows.

### Refactoring Steps
- **Create a Separate Routing Module**: 
  - Move all route definitions to a new file, e.g., `src/routes/index.js`.
  - Export a function that returns the routes, allowing for easier modifications and additions in the future.

- **Dynamic Route Loading (optional for now)**:
  - Implement lazy loading for routes using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to improve performance by loading components only when needed.

- **Route Configuration**:
  - Define a route configuration object that maps paths to components. This will allow for easier management of routes and their properties (like authentication requirements).

### Example Code
```
javascript
// src/routes/zoo_routes.js
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
const ZooWorkSheet1 = lazy(() => import('./zooWorkSheet1'));
const ZooWorkSheet2 = lazy(() => import('./zooWorkSheet2'));
const ZooWorkSheet3 = lazy(() => import('./zooWorkSheet3'));
const RouteConfig = () => (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/zooworksheet1" element={<ZooWorkSheet1 />} />
            <Route path="/zooworksheet2" element={<ZooWorkSheet2 />} />
            <Route path="/zooworksheet3" element={<ZooWorkSheet3 />} />
            {/ Add more routes here /}
        </Routes>
    </Suspense>
);
export default RouteConfig;
```


## 2. Pages

### Current State
- Each worksheet is implemented as a separate component in the `src/routes` directory.
- The components are large and contain a mix of logic, rendering, and styles, making them hard to read and maintain.

### Refactoring Steps
- **Organize Pages into Folders**:
  - Create a folder for each major feature (e.g., `src/pages/Zoo`, `src/pages/Psychology`, etc.) to group related worksheets.

- **Split Large Components**:
  - Break down large components into smaller, reusable components. For example, separate the logic for handling user input, displaying results, and rendering UI elements.

- **Use a Consistent Structure**:
  - Ensure that each page component follows a consistent structure, including hooks for state management, effect hooks for side effects, and a clear separation of concerns.

### Example Code

```
javascript
// src/pages/Zoo/ZooWorkSheet1.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { fetchWorksheetProgress } from '../../worksheet';
import TermList from './TermList';
import DefinitionList from './DefinitionList';
import ResultDisplay from './ResultDisplay';
const ZooWorkSheet1 = () => {
    const [matches, setMatches] = useState({});
    const [showResults, setShowResults] = useState(false);
    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchProgress = async () => {
            const progressData = await fetchWorksheetProgress('zoo-worksheet-1');
            setMatches(progressData.progress || {});
        };
            fetchProgress();
    }, []);
    return (
        <div>
            <TermList matches={matches} setMatches={setMatches} />
                <DefinitionList matches={matches} />
            <ResultDisplay showResults={showResults} matches={matches} />
        </div>
    );
};
export default ZooWorkSheet1;
```
## 3. Worksheets
### Consolidate Common Logic
- **Create Custom Hooks**: Extract common logic into reusable hooks like `useFetchProgress` and `useTermManagement` to manage fetching progress and term selection.

### Simplify Individual Worksheet Components
- **Break Down Components**: Split large components into smaller, focused components (e.g., `TermList`, `DefinitionList`, `ResultDisplay`).

### Improve User Feedback and Error Handling
- **Add Loading States**: Implement loading indicators and provide clear feedback for user actions.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling for asynchronous operations to inform users of issues.
